## Question 1

An analogue signal received at a detector, measured in microvolts, is normally
distributed with mean of 200 and variance of 256.

that is, X ∼ N(200, 16).

(a) What is the probability that the signal will exceed 224 𝜇V?

P(X > 224)

```{r 1.a}
1-pnorm(224,200,16)

curve(dnorm(x, 200, 16), 240, 160, xlab = "x", ylab = "f(x)")
x <- seq(224, 240, 0.01) #values of x in the range 40–50 in intervals of 0.01
lines (x, dnorm(x, mean = 200, sd = 16), type = "h",
col = "grey") #shading
```

(b) What is the probability that it will be between 186 and 224 𝜇V?

P(X < 224|X > 186) = $\frac{P((X<224)∩(X>186))}{P((X>186)}$ = $\frac{P(186 < X< 224)}{P(X>186)}$

P(186 < X< 224)=
```{r 1.b.1}
a <- pnorm(224,200,16)-pnorm(186,200,16)
a
```

P(X>186) = 
```{r 1.b.2}
b <- 1-pnorm(186,200,16)
b
```

$\frac{P(186 < X< 224)}{P(X>186)}$ = 

```{r 1.b.3}
c <- a/b
c
curve(dnorm(x, 200, 16), 240, 160, xlab = "x", ylab = "f(x)")
x <- seq(186, 224, 0.01) #values of x in the range 40–50 in intervals of 0.01
lines (x, dnorm(x, mean = 200, sd = 16), type = "h",
col = "grey") #shading
```

(c) What is the micro voltage below which 25% of the signals will be?

(d) What is the probability that the signal will be less than 240 𝜇V, given that it is larger than 210 𝜇V?

P(X < 240|X > 210)
```{r 1.d}
pnorm(240,200,16)-pnorm(210,200,16)

curve(dnorm(x, 200, 16), 260, 140, xlab = "x", ylab = "f(x)")
x <- seq(210, 240, 0.01) #values of x in the range 40–50 in intervals of 0.01
lines (x, dnorm(x, mean = 200, sd = 16), type = "h",
col = "grey") #shading
```

(e) Estimate the interquartile range.

(f) What is the probability that the signal will be less than 220 𝜇V, given that
it is larger than 210 𝜇V?

P(X < 220|X > 210)

```{r 1.f}
pnorm(220,200,16)-pnorm(210,200,16)

curve(dnorm(x, 200, 16), 240, 160, xlab = "x", ylab = "f(x)")
x <- seq(210, 220, 0.01) #values of x in the range 40–50 in intervals of 0.01
lines (x, dnorm(x, mean = 200, sd = 16), type = "h",
col = "grey") #shading
```

(g) If we know that a received signal is greater that 200 𝜇V, what is the probability that is in fact greater than 220 𝜇V?

## Question 2

A manufacturer of a particular type of computer system is interested in improving its customer support services. As a first step, its marketing department has
been charged with the responsibility of summarizing the extent of customer
problems in terms of system failures. Over a period of six months, customers
were surveyed and the amount of downtime (in minutes) due to system failures
they had experienced during the previous month was collected. The average
downtime was found to be 25 minutes and a variance of 144. If it can be
assumed that downtime is normally distributed:

(a) obtain bounds which will include 95% of the downtime of all the customers;

(b) obtain the bound above which 10% of the downtime is included.
